### 👋 Hi there, I'm Ismael Braz!

💻 I'm a **Fullstack Developer** at **Carrot Incentives**, where I work mainly on the **backend** using **Java (Quarkus)** within a **microservices architecture**. I also handle **Docker image builds** and **deployments**, giving me hands-on experience with **containerization** and **deployment workflows**.

🎓 I graduated from **42 Lisboa**, where I developed a strong foundation in **software engineering**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving** through project-based learning.

⚙️ My main interests include **backend architecture**, **API design**, and **scalable web applications**, but I also enjoy creating solid and intuitive **frontend experiences** when needed.

🚀 I’m always open to collaborating on challenging and meaningful projects that push me to learn and grow as a developer.

📫 You can reach me at [ismael.braz03@hotmail.com](mailto:ismael.braz03@hotmail.com)  
or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismael-silva-aa04a723a/).

🎵 Fun fact: I love music — and people say I’m a pretty good singer!
